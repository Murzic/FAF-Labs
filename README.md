FAF-Labs
========

A place for the lecturers to keep track of the assignments.

Installation
------------

Although not required, it's good to have [RVM](https://rvm.io/) on your system (hopefully you're not on Windows).

`cd` into the directory, it'll ask you to install ruby-2.0.0-p0 if you don't have it. If you're not using RVM, you can install that separately.

Then do the following:

    gem install bundler
    bundle install
    
It will download and install all the necessary libraries. If some of them fail, open an issue and we'll update this guide with proper instructions.
